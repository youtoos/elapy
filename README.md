# About elapy
This is a Python implementation of Energy Landscape Analysis Toolbox/Toolkit (ELAT). An Ising model is fit to the input data that should be a {0,1}-valued or {-1,1}-valued matrix. From the estimated Ising model, local minimum patterns, basins of attractions, and a disconnectivity graph showing energy barriers between local minimum patterns are calculated. For more details, please see the original repository or the original paper shown below.

The original Matlab codes written by Dr. T. Ezaki are available at: https://github.com/tkEzaki/energy-landscape-analysis.

# Required packages

# Install
```
git clone https://github.com/okumakito/elapy.git
```

# Usage

* Import
  ```
  import elapy as ela
  ```
* Convert your data to a {0,1}-valued pandas DataFrame object with rows represent variables and columns represent observations or time points. You can load a test data provided by the original repository (https://github.com/tkEzaki/energy-landscape-analysis) by the following command:
  ```
  data = ela.load_testdata(1)  # the argument is 1, 2, 3, or 4
  ```
* Fit an Ising model to the data. Please choose one from the two functions below depending on the data size.
  ```
  h, W = ela.fit_exact(data)  # exact fitting based on likelihood function
  h, W = ela.fit_approx(data) # approximated fitting based on pseudo-likelihood function
  ```
* Check fitting accuracy scores. The first measure is baesd on Shannon entropy. The second measure is based on Kullback–Leibler divergence. Both measures take 1 for the best fitting and 0 for the worst fitting. The values of the two measures are always the same for the case of exact fitting.
  ```
  acc1, acc2 = ela.calc_accuracy(h, W, data)
  print(acc1, acc2)
  ```
* Calculate a basin graph.
  ```
  graph = ela.calc_basin_graph(h, W, data)
  ```
* Calculate a disconnectivity graph.
  ```
  D = ela.calc_discon_graph(h, W, data, graph)
  ```
* Calculate each state's frequency and transitions between states.
  ```
  freq, trans, trans2 = ela.calc_trans(data, graph)
  ```
* Calculate transition matrix based on Boltzmann machine.
  ```
  P = ela.calc_trans_bm(h, W, data)
  ```
* Plot figures
  ```
  ela.plot_local_min(data, graph)
  ela.plot_basin_graph(graph)
  ela.plot_discon_graph(D)
  ela.plot_landscape(D)
  ela.plot_landscape3d(D)
  ela.plot_trans(freq, trans, trans2)
  ```
 
# Major differences from the original codes

* Each {0,1}-valued vector is encoded to a decimal value differently from the original codes. The last element is taken as the most significant bit (MSB) in the original codes (for example, [0,0,0,1] -> 8) whereas the first element is taken as the MSB in this implementation (for example, [0,0,0,1] -> 1). Moreover, 1 is added to each decimal value in the original codes to avoid 0. The original notations can be used in `plot_basin_graph` function as follows:
  ```
  ela.plot_basin_graph(graph, original_notation=True)
  ```
* 3D plot of a basin graph is not provided in this repository.
* `calc_trans_bm` is added to calculate the transition matrix based on Boltzmann machine. The transition probability is for the case of synchronous updates, that is, when the values of all variables are updated simultaneously. The row number and column number correspond to the destination node number and source node number, respectively. 
* `plot_landscape` is added to show a  two-dimensional landscape reconstructed from the disconnectivity graph. Movement is only allowed on the white lines.
* `plot_landscape3d` is added to show a  three-dimensional landscape reconstructed from the disconnectivity graph. Movement is only allowed on the white lines.
